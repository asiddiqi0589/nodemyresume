Myresume NODEJS/EXPRESS TUTORIAL - ruff 

// this tutorial is using express.js 
// you need to have node installed for this
// you will also need npm 
// go to www.expressjs.com and check it out, read into it. 

- create folder called myresume 
- cd to my resume folder 
-   go to terminal and run npm init which is goign to create a package.json file for us

- ADDING EXPPRESS MODULE TO PACKAGE.JSON FILE 
we can do this by using the command from the website or adding it to the package.json file. 
here we have added it to the package.json file 

{
  "name": "myresume",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "simple express application ",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies" : {

    "express" : "*",
    "body-parser" : "*"
  }

after you add the dependencies, run the npm install in the terminal and it will install any dependencies you have mentioned. (short desc of the stuff)

After you run the npm command you will notice the node_modules folder in the folder myresume. 

now we need to create our (entry file) app.js 
In your editor create a file called app.js 

first thing we are going to is reuqire express
var express = require('express'); 

second body parser (explain this)
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');

 path module (explain this)
var path = require('path');



Instantiate our express application 

create variable called app and set it to express

Middle ware (explain this)
A function that has access to req and responce methods
- execute code 
- make changes to req and res

//middleware function
app.use(function(req, res, next){
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now());
  
  next();
});

//body parsers middleware 
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));


//creating route 
app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.send("hello");
});

run command node myresume 
 
go into the browser 
http://localhost:3000/

and youl see hell0

install nodemon so you dont have to keep running the node command
run nodemon - 
run node myresume 


create about route
we need to create a route to navigate to it. 

app.get('/about', function(req, res){
  res.send("About me");
});

now go to 

http://localhost:3000/about






}
