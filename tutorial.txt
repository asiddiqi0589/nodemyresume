STEP 1
Myresume NODEJS/EXPRESS TUTORIAL - ruff 

// this tutorial is using express.js 
// you need to have node installed for this
// you will also need npm 
// go to www.expressjs.com and check it out, read into it. 

- create folder called myresume 
- cd to my resume folder 
-   go to terminal and run npm init which is goign to create a package.json file for us

- ADDING EXPPRESS MODULE TO PACKAGE.JSON FILE 
we can do this by using the command from the website or adding it to the package.json file. 
here we have added it to the package.json file 

{
  "name": "myresume",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "simple express application ",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies" : {

    "express" : "*",
    "body-parser" : "*"
  }

after you add the dependencies, run the npm install in the terminal and it will install any dependencies you have mentioned. (short desc of the stuff)

After you run the npm command you will notice the node_modules folder in the folder myresume. 

now we need to create our (entry file) app.js 
In your editor create a file called app.js 

first thing we are going to is reuqire express
var express = require('express'); 

second body parser (explain this)
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');

 path module (explain this)
var path = require('path');



Instantiate our express application 

create variable called app and set it to express

Middle ware (explain this)
A function that has access to req and responce methods
- execute code 
- make changes to req and res

//middleware function
app.use(function(req, res, next){
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now());
  
  next();
});

//body parsers middleware 
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));


//creating route 
app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.send("hello");
});

run command node myresume 
 
go into the browser 
http://localhost:3000/

and youl see hell0

install nodemon so you dont have to keep running the node command
run nodemon - 
run node myresume 


create about route
we need to create a route to navigate to it. 

app.get('/about', function(req, res){
  res.send("About me");
});

now go to 

http://localhost:3000/about
now you see about me 

STEP 2  

now we need to install EJS 
EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. ejs will make your life easy and it is very easy to install. 

Run npm install ejs --save into the termnal, this will add ejs to the packake.json file 

create a views folder 
in the views folder create the following files
//views folder 
create an index.ejs file // this will be the home page 
create an about.ejs file // this will be the about page 
create an school.ejs file // this will be the school page 
create an experance.ejs file // this will be the experiance page
create an contact.ejs file // this will be the hope page 

//implement bootstrap
create incldues folder inside the views folder 
//create head.ejs file 
//create footer.ejs file 

open head.ejs file 
and (below) html to it, this bootstrap code is easy to understand. 
note we have added the about/school/contact pages to the navigation

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-inverse">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="navbar-header">
          <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbar" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="navbar">
            <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
            <span class="icon-bar"></span>
            <span class="icon-bar"></span>
            <span class="icon-bar"></span>
          </button>
          <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">My Website</a>
        </div>
        <div id="navbar" class="collapse navbar-collapse">
          <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="/experience">Work Experience </a></li>
            <li><a href="/school">School</a></li>
            <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
          </ul>
        </div><!--/.nav-collapse -->
      </div>
    </nav>

    <div class="container">

open index.ejs file to include the includes folder

<%- include('includes/head') %>
<h1>hello world</h1>

if you have nodemon running you can see the navbar and the helloworld in the h1 tag. 

open the app.js file 

lets create the about/experience/school/contact route 


app.get('/about', function(req, res){
  res.render("about");
});

app.get('/experience', function(req, res){
  res.render("experience");
});

app.get('/school', function(req, res){
  res.render("school");
});

app.get('/contact', function(req, res){
  res.render("contact");
});

open the about.ejs file and add
<h1>About Me</h1>

please navigate to about
http://localhost:3000/about

As you can see the About me appears in the page but the bootstrap is missing, this is because we have not included in the about.ejs page

add the include to the about.ejs /contact.ejs/experience.ejs and school.ejs pages. 

<%- include('includes/head') %>

Now when you navigate you can see the titles of the page with the top navigation. 

Lets add a footer.ejs file to the includes folder and the closing tag of the div container in it. you can add other things to the footer if you like. 

Now just like the include we need to add the footer to all the pages. 

<%- include('includes/footer') %>
